This is a very simple calculator application written in Java in Android Studio

To run the application:

1. Simply clone the repository in GitHub Desktop

2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Select an emulator in the device manager 
(The layout works best with taller screens but can be used with just about any emulator)

4. Run the app on your selected device

5. Test out whatever you'd like!
